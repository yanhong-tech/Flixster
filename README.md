### Notes

* Challenge for the youtube API. The walkthrough videos help, but I wonder it will be hard if I do it by myself. 
* I feel a lot of things can do for this app, so I will spend more time to finish and improve more

### Notes

* how to layout good as well as try to figure out the warp_content and match_parent;

* overall is good. I am in the process.
